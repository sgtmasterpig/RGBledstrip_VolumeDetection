# RGBledstrip_VolumeDetection

This is an early beta for a program i'm building to send RGB values to a ledstrip and use Processing to make a gui with beat detection, volume detection and a whole bunch of effects.

i'm using the arduino nano with pins 9,10 and 11 for WPM
in processing you will have to change line 56 to suite your port, i still have to look into making this automatic.
upload to arduino first, then change the port in processing and run the program.
